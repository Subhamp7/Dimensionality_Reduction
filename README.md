# Dimensionality_Reduction

With increase number of attributes the accuracy can be affected or the model can be overfitted.So we can either remove some features of extract information from the features into a single attribute.

There are two components of dimensionality reduction:

### Feature selection: 
    In this, we try to find a subset of the original set of variables, or features, to get a smaller subset which can be used to model the problem. 
### Feature extraction: 
    This reduces the data in a high dimensional space to a lower dimension space, i.e. a space with lesser no. of dimensions.

Dimensionality reduction, or dimension reduction, is the transformation of data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data.

The various methods used for dimensionality reduction include:
### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
### Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
### Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA)
